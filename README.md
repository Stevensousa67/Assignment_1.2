# Project_1.2
@Author: Steven Sousa
@version: 1.2
@release date: December 2023

This repository contains the code for Assignment 1.2 from COMP390-002. The only external library needed to run this 
project is xlwt and pytest. To run the project, simply open main.py, hit run (inside main.py), and follow the prompts in
the terminal.

The purpose of this application is to filter a large data set from NASA. The dataset is called meteorite_landings_data.txt
that contains collection of 45,716 data entries. Each entry has information about a single meteorite landing on Earth. 
During runtime, the user will select if the data should be filtered by mass or year. If selecting mass, the user will
set the upper and lower bounds of the mass filter. If selecting year, the user will specify the lower limit (starting
year) and the upper limit (ending year). The program will then ask the ask user if they'd like the filtered results to be
neatly displayed in the terminal, exported to a .txt file or a .xls file. The filtered results will be arranged just as
they are structured in the source data. After displaying or exporting the filtered data, the program will close. The 
exported files will be created within the directory of the project.
